This project was built partially in R but primarily in Foundry
The Palantir Foundry application I built analyzes the impact of U.S. foreign aid on democracy across 150+ countries over the past two decades. 
Using AIP Agents, interactive dashboards, and structured datasets, this app allows users to ask natural language questions and receive response describing causality and actionable foreign aid policy recommendations.
The AI Agent is powered by GPT-4o
